# RaspberryPi_FM_Transmitter
RaspberryPi-FMTransmitter
#The following is a project I developed and I'm going to begin with the following warning. This is not legal for long range broadcast.
#It is illegal to broadcast over certain frequencies in most nations. Don't get arrested.
#
#
#This project started out as a timed lyric reader, then to a lrc -> display module, and then turned into a full-scale transmitter.
#The transmitter was not mine, and was developed by ###FILL THIS IN####. The link to his github is here, and will be necessary later in the project

#I created this project on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a 40x2 HD7780 Display, and a few buttons and wires.
