[00:14.44]You don't make me sorry
[00:19.01]Now I know
[00:23.12]That you never listened, listen
[00:28.33]Thinking about that high school dance

[00:56.19]Don't worry about it, honey
[00:58.37]I never needed anybody
[01:00.56]I never needed anybody, it won't change now

[02:12.26]We've stayed up
[02:16.91]All night tryin', tryin'
[02:21.77]Never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
[02:26.34]I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
[02:31.09]Don't worry about it, honey
[02:33.21]I never needed anybody
[02:35.64]I never needed anybody, it won't change now
[02:41.23]Am I wrong?
[02:44.91]Don't sing along with me
[02:49.46]I said I was fine
[02:54.26]The second time
[02:56.25]We lost the war
