[00:11.66]When they say promises
[00:15.16]They mean promises
[00:21.16]♪
[00:25.31]They'd say, "that's ok
[00:28.84]Long as we can celebrate"
[00:34.72]You see, my uncle would say
[00:39.27]Things would change when he's dead
[00:42.41]"Meet me in the bathroom"
[00:44.35]That's what she said
[00:45.98]I don't mind... it's true
[00:51.01]♪
[01:06.74]Never was on time
[01:09.99]Yes, I once was mine
[01:13.05]Well, that was long ago
[01:16.76]And darling, I don't mind
[01:19.91]Yeah, we were just two friends in lust
[01:23.18]And baby, that just don't mean much
[01:26.57]You trained me not to love
[01:29.99]After you showed me what it was
[01:33.91]Now she's staring wide-eyed
[01:38.10]Can't close her eyes
[01:42.44]♪
[01:46.62]Say what?
[01:47.79]Anywhere is fine
[01:51.36]Just don't waste my time
[01:57.22]You see, my uncle would say
[02:01.63]Things would change once he's dead
[02:04.95]"Meet me in the bathroom"
[02:06.70]That's what she said
[02:08.51]I don't mind... it's true
[02:14.71]♪
[02:18.84]Never was on time
[02:22.20]Yes, I once was mine
[02:25.44]Well, that was long ago
[02:28.63]And darling, I don't mind
[02:31.97]Yeah, they were just two fucks in lust
[02:35.31]Baby, that just don't mean much
[02:38.83]You trained me not to love
[02:42.32]After you taught me what it was
[02:45.29]♪
