[00:34.81]I'm tired of everyone I know
[00:52.18]Of everyone I see
[01:00.85]On the street
[01:04.61]And on TV, yeah
[01:10.23]On the other side
[01:14.91]On the other side
[01:19.97]Nobody's waiting for me
[01:23.69]On the other side
[01:28.40]♪
[01:45.49]I hate them all
[01:49.79]I hate them all
[01:53.82]I hate myself
[01:58.33]For hating them
[02:02.78]So drink some more
[02:07.15]I'll love them all
[02:11.84]I'll drink even more
[02:16.10]I'll hate them even more than I did before
[02:20.99]On the other side
[02:25.42]On the other side
[02:30.28]Nobody's waiting for me
[02:34.15]On the other side
[02:38.80]♪
[02:44.22]I remember when you came
[02:52.71]You taught me how to sing
[03:01.42]Now, it seems so far away
[03:10.29]You taught me how to sing
[03:17.87]I'm tired
[03:22.15]Of being
[03:26.34]So judgmental
[03:31.01]Of everyone
[03:35.95]I will not go to sleep
[03:40.10]I will train my eyes to see
[03:43.78]And my mind is as blind
[03:48.06]As a branch on a tree
[03:53.38]On the other side
[03:57.84]On the other side
[04:02.78]I know what's waiting for me
[04:06.62]On the other side
[04:10.95]On the other side
[04:15.36]On the other side
[04:20.21]I know you're waiting for me
[04:24.35]On the other side
[04:26.77]♪
