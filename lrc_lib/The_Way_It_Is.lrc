[00:20.89]She was still sleeping
[00:23.89]The problem will stay
[00:27.83]♪
[00:30.69]One more day
[00:34.63]Said she's not sorry
[00:37.83]The wind blows her way
[00:41.78]Accidents happen
[00:44.85]There's one planned today
[00:49.04]Oh, you see
[00:50.80]I wish it was not true
[00:52.59]But that's the way it is
[00:54.32]It's not your fault
[00:55.98]That's the way it is
[00:57.75]I'm sick of you
[00:59.32]And that's the way it is
[01:01.71]And will always be
[01:05.44]♪
[01:32.32]Wednesday is over
[01:35.49]It's over again
[01:39.47]Said my goodbyes
[01:41.85]To the life we won't spend
[01:46.74]Together
[01:48.61]I wish it was not true
[01:50.25]But that's the way it is
[01:51.80]It's not your fault
[01:53.58]That's the way it is
[01:55.36]I'm sick of you
[01:57.08]And that's the way it is
[02:01.84]But that's not your problem
[02:05.68]That's not a problem
[02:09.32]That's not my problem
[02:12.65]That's not your problem
[02:17.23]♪
