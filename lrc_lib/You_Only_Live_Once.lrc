[00:22.65]Some people think they're always right
[00:26.65]Others are quiet and uptight
[00:30.63]Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh
[00:34.68]Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh, no
[00:38.64]Twenty-nine different attributes
[00:42.79]Only seven that you like, oh-oh
[00:46.62]Twenty ways to see the world, oh
[00:50.54]And twenty ways to start a fight, oh
[00:55.08]Oh don't, don't, don't get up
[01:00.25]I can't see the sunshine
[01:04.13]I'll be waiting for you, baby
[01:09.53]'Cause I'm through
[01:11.58]Sit me down
[01:15.55]Shut me up
[01:19.25]I'll calm down
[01:24.07]And I'll get along with you

[01:40.32]Oh, men don't notice what they got
[01:44.41]Oh, women think of that a lot
[01:48.31]One thousand ways to please your man, oh
[01:52.24]Not even one requires a plan, I know
[01:56.26]And countless odd religions too
[02:00.32]It doesn't matter which you choose, oh, no
[02:04.22]One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
[02:08.33]This I've tried and now refuse, oh
[02:12.71]Oh don't, don't, don't get up
[02:17.97]I can't see the sunshine
[02:21.52]Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby
[02:26.94]'Cause I'm through
[02:29.13]Sit me down
[02:32.98]Shut me up
[02:36.75]I'll calm down
[02:41.69]And I'll get along with you
[02:45.14]Alright
[02:47.29]Shut me up, shut me up
[02:55.47]And I'll get along with you
[02:58.00]♪
